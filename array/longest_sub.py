# Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given sequence / array.
# In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequenceâ€™s elements are in strictly increasing order,
# and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
# This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
# In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
#
# Example :
#
# Input : [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
# Output : 6
# The sequence : [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]
class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @return an integer

        length = len(A)

        subsequence = [1]*length



        for i in range(1,length):
            for j in range(0,i):
                if A[i] > A[j] and subsequence[i] < (subsequence[j] + 1):
                    subsequence[i] = subsequence[j]+1
        maximum = 0
        for i in range(length):
            maximum = max(maximum,subsequence[i])

        return maximum
